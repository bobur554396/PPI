Welcome to the repository for **Programming Principles I (CSCI1103)** – Lecture Notes and Example Code – taught as part of the **School of IT and Engineering** at **Kazakh-British Technical University (KBTU)**.

This repository contains lecture-related **example code, practical snippets, and concept explanations** designed to support students enrolled in this course. It serves as a companion resource to weekly lectures and labs.

## Course Overview

The course introduces foundational programming principles using the C++ language. Key areas include:

- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- C++ syntax and structure
- Conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and strings
- Introduction to pointers, structures, recursion, and STL
- Writing modular and well-structured programs

No prior programming experience is required.
