Welcome to the official repository for **Programming Principles I (CSCI1103)** offered by the **School of IT and Engineering** at **Kazakh-British Technical University (KBTU)**.

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of programming using the **C++** language. It is designed for first-year students with **no prior programming experience**. Through hands-on labs, quizzes, and guided examples, students will learn to write, compile, debug, and structure real-world C++ programs.

## Course Overview

The course introduces foundational programming principles using the C++ language. Key areas include:

- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- C++ syntax and structure
- Conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and strings
- Introduction to pointers, structures, recursion, and STL
- Writing modular and well-structured programs

No prior programming experience is required.
