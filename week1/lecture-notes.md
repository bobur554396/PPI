# Lecture 1 — Introduction to Programming and C++

## 🧩 What is a Program?

A **program** is a list of instructions written by a human to be executed by a computer.

- Computers understand **machine code**: a binary language of `0` and `1`
- Humans need tools to translate their instructions into machine code, they are - programming languages

## 🔁 Human Language → Machine Language

To convert programming languages into machine code, we use **translators**:

### 1. Compiler

- Translates the **entire code at once**
- Examples of compiled languages:  
  `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `C#`

### 2. Interpreter

- Translates code **line by line**
- Examples of interpreted languages:  
  `Python`, `Ruby`, `JavaScript`

## 💻 Programming Languages Overview

### High-Level Languages

- Closer to human language
- Easier to learn and write
- Examples:  
  `Python`, `Ruby`, `Java`, `C#`, `JavaScript`

### Mid-Level Languages

- Balance between high-level and low-level control
- Examples:  
  `C`, `C++`, `Perl`, `Java`, `C#`

### Low-Level Languages

- Close to machine/hardware level
- Harder to write and read
- Example:  
  `Assembly`

## 💬 About C++

- **C++** is a **compiled**, mid-level programming language
- Uses a **compiler**: `MinGW g++`
- Recommended editor: **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**
