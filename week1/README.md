# Week 1

## 1. Objective

This week's objective is to introduce students to the basics of programming, focusing on the concept of how humans communicate with computers through programming languages. Students will also learn how to prepare their **C++ development environment**, write simple programs, and understand the foundational building blocks of the language.

In addition, students will become familiar with compiling and running C++ programs via the **terminal** and get introduced to the **Ejudge** system, which will be used for submitting and testing assignments throughout the course.

## 2. Tasks

### 2.1 Setup C++ Compilation Environment

Follow the platform-specific instructions in the [C++ Compilation Guide](cpp%20compile%20guide.md) provided in this repository.

You must be able to:

- Compile `.cpp` files using `g++`
- Run the compiled executable from the terminal (CMD, PowerShell, Bash)

💡 **Example commands**:

```bash
g++ hello.cpp
./a.exe     # On Windows
./a.out     # On Linux/macOS
```

### 2.2 Install Visual Studio Code

- Download and install from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Do **not** install additional extensions
- Learn how to open a folder and terminal from VS Code
